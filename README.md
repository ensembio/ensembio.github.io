# Our Theme

This is a two-column [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) theme based on http://hyde.getpoole.com/, which in turn is based on [Poole](http://getpoole.com), the Jekyll butler.

Much has been customized, so at some point it's long longer accurate to say it's based on anything. Like they say, it's complicated.
